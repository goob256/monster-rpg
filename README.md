# Monster 1

Monster 1 is a classic style JRPG in the theme of old NES titles of the 80s
and 90s. Like those RPGs, you gain experience and level up through combat,
while talking to characters and advancing in your quest to save your child
from the hands of a monster.

Monster 1 is a "loose prequel" to the [Monster RPG 2](http://www.nooskewl.ca/monster-rpg-2) game.
